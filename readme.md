# pymediamicroservices

This is a Python 3 port of [mediamicroservices](https://github.com/mediamicroservices/mm)

The rationale is basically trying to make it easier for us to track issues with `mm` that are really hard to follow in `bash` since so much of that code is not relevant to our workflows. 

Also, since we are using `mm` in conjunction with `php` and other Python scripts, I am going to see if we can simplify a bit.
